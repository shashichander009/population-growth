# UN Population Data Analysis

Do you want to understand how the world population has grown over the years? This project will show you the world population growth story through beautiful charts.  

## Data

We are using data released by [United Nations]( https://datahub.io/core/population-growth-estimates-and-projections/r/population-estimates.csv) to understand the population growth.

## Language and Libraries

This project is built in Python 3.7.4 and uses standard Python libraries. Apart from that, we have also used [matplotlib]( https://matplotlib.org/) to plot those beautiful charts. 


## Installation

clone this repo

create a virtual environment and activate it 

move to this folder dataproblem-population 

install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Last Step, run the program 

```bash
python un_data_analysis.py
```

## Usage
When you run this first time, you will get two options

```bash
0: Download Data
5: Quit
```


Enter 0 to download data. We can't process data without downloading it.

Once data is downloaded, you can enter the appropriate option to see the charts

```bash
1: India population over years - Bar Plot
2: Bar Chart of the population of ASEAN countries in 2014
3: Total population of SAARC countries over the years
4: Grouped Bar Chart - ASEAN population vs. years
5: Quit 
```
Once you are done, you can quit by choosing option 5. 

Thank you
